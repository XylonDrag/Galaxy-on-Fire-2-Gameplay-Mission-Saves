• These Save files were made with KritoJPK's GOF2 RE FHD
• These missions will work for the GOF2 OG, both the one from Google Play Store & KritoJPK's GOF2 HD OG, with two exceptions:
• 1) Before leaving the hanger, you will need to unequip your weapons and equipment and then re-equip them, due to the modded slots in RE. Otherwise for instance, You might end up with a Rhoda Blackhole in a weapon slot instead of the equipment slot, and the game will crash! So don't skip this step if playing in GOF2 OG!
• 2) Also you will need to use KritoJPK's Save Fix APK to use these files in GOF2 OG
